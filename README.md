# Portfolio

This is just a README. You will find the actual website in this link. <br>

This is my portfolio. It has a welcoming page, a projects section, an about section and also a contact form.

I have made my website responsive to width sizes from 1440px to 320px. In the navbar, you can download my resume and also navigate to the other pages. My social media handles are present in the left aside section of the page. The logo , the social media handles and the scroll indicator have been kept fixed. In the welcoming page you can also send me an email by clicking the Say Hello button.

In the projects section, each tile contains a link to the respective github repositories. And when you hover above them, you can find the project description. 

In the contact form, I have done form validation using javaScript. An error pops up if you leave even any of the boxes. Once you have filled out the form completely, when you enter send message, the message is delivered to my gmail. This feature helps the website be more realistic rather than a CSE student's project. 

Thank You.
